Project: C Programming - ALX School

Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Program's C Programming projects repository. This repository contains the following project directories:

    0x00-hello_world: This project introduces you to the basics of C programming, including compiling and running C code.

    0x01-variables_if_else_while: In this project, you'll learn about variables, conditionals (if-else statements), and while loops in C.

    0x02-functions_nested_loops: You'll explore functions and nested loops in C to build more complex programs in this project.

    0x03-debugging: The debugging project will teach you the essential skill of debugging C code to identify and fix errors.

    0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: This project delves deeper into functions and nested loops to solve more complex problems.

    0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: Learn about pointers, arrays, and strings, which are fundamental concepts in C programming.

    0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: Continue building your skills in working with pointers, arrays, and strings.

    0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: Further develop your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings to tackle more advanced tasks.
